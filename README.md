# XAML Designer Extensibility Documents & Samples

Starting in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.3, the XAML designer supports two different architectures: the designer isolation architecture and the
more recent surface isolation architecture. [This article](./documents/xaml-designer-extensibility-migration.md) explains the changes in detail. The [samples](./samples) folder contains code samples that demonstrate how to use XAML designer extensibility.
